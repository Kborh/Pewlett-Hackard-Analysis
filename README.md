# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, 
but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. A quick query helped inform HR that they have 
33,118 current employees who are eligible for retirement. These current retire-eligible employees can be found here:
Project/Data/tbl_current_emp.csv.

## Resources
    Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
    Software: Postgres, pgAdmin
    
    
## Objectives
     .Design an ERD that applies to the data.
     .Create and use a SQL database.
     .Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
     .Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
     .Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
     
## Challenge Overview
   In this challenge, we used advanced queries and joins to create a list of candidates for the mentorship program. 
   To complete this task, we used our knowledge of aliasing, filtering, and creating new tables.
