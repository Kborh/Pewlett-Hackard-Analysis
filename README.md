# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, 
but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. A quick query helped inform HR that they have 
33,118 current employees who are eligible for retirement. These current retire-eligible employees can be found here:
Project/Data/tbl_current_emp.csv.
