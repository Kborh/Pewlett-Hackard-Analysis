# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, 
but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. A quick query helped inform HR that they have 
33,118 current employees who are eligible for retirement. These current retire-eligible employees can be found here:
Project/Data/tbl_current_emp.csv.

## Resources
    Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
    Software: Postgres, pgAdmin
    
    
## Objectives
     . Design an ERD that applies to the data.
     . Create and use a SQL database.
     . Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
     . Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
     . Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
     
     
## EmployeeDB ERD
   This flowchart, also known as ERD diagram, depits the entity relationship between tables. 
   This diagram serves as blue print for our database, with all our tables are connected on primary keys,
   and data types. The benefit for building out each form of diagram is gives us more exposure to data and its layout.
   When writing queries in SQL, data is organized into tables, as shown in the ERD. With the help of the diagram, 
   we know the structure of the table: the amount of columns with their data types. The table can be, already, named. 
   All we need to do is transfer over the same information.

## Challenge Overview
   In this challenge, we used advanced queries and joins to create a list of candidates for the mentorship program. 
   To complete this task, we used our knowledge of aliasing, filtering, and creating new tables.
   
   
## Challenge Objectives
     . Use an ERD to understand relationships between SQL tables.
     . Create new tables in pgAdmin by using different joins.
     . Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
     . Export new tables to a CSV file.
